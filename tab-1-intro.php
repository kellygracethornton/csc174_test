			<p>These words describe some of the most important aspects of my being. One word that was up there for a long time and recently fell away was medicine junkie. One word that will be up there soon is changemaker. The ones you see -- and even the ones you donâ€™t -- are all connected:  I tell stories and build communities in order to inspire change, to spark a roaring fire in others. I do not always do this within Africa, but my heart is always calling for the continent, which I consider my home. If this sounds grand, lofty or pretentious, perhaps a glimpse into my background will help.</p>
